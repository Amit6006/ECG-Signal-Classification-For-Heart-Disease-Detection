# ECG-Signal-Classification-For-Heart-Disease-Detection
A Full Stack Web Application that aim to help clients to detect heart condition by analyzing their ECG signals, we used alexnet which is a deep learning model and it classifies the heart condition into 3 categories with and accuracy of 94%. 

We used ECG signals of three categories:
  •	Cardiac Arrhythmia (ARR)
  •	Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 
  •	Normal Sinus Rhythms (NSR).
  
These signals are obtained from 162 ECG recordings from three PhysioNet databases:
  •	MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (96 Recordings) [ARR Signals]
  •	MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (30 Recordings) [NSR Signals] 
  •	BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database (36 Recordings) [CHF Signals].

Applying CWT on these 1D signals will give 2D scalograms that will be stored.(see ecgdataset.zip)
